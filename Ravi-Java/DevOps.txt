		1: what are the steps involved in project deployment.
			Check-in the code from all projects in progress into the SVN or source code repository and tag it.
			Download the complete source code from SVN.
			Build the application.
			Store the build output either WAR or EAR file to a common network location.
			Get the file from network and deploy the file to the certified site.
			Updated the documentation with date and updated version number of the application.
		
		2: what are the phases of a Maven Build LifeCycle?
			Following are the phases −
			validate − validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
			compile − compile the source code of the project.
			test − test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
			package − take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
			integration-test − process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run
			verify − run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
			install − install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
			deploy − done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
