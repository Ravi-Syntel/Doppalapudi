1:Different SQL JOINS
	INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
	LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
	RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
	FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
	
	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
	FROM Orders
	INNER JOIN Customers
	ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

2:we have the following constraints:
	NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot store NULL value
	UNIQUE - Ensures that each row for a column must have a unique value
	PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Ensures that a column (or combination of two or more columns) have a unique identity which helps to find a particular record in a table more easily and quickly
	FOREIGN KEY - Ensure the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table
	CHECK - Ensures that the value in a column meets a specific condition
	DEFAULT - Specifies a default value for a column


main diffences between procedure and function as follows

              procedure                                                                    function
1>procedure is used for performing                            1> its used for computing value
   action                                                                                 and returning value

2> procedure may or maynot return                             2> function must and should 
     value                                                                              return value

                                                                                            statement
4> its cant be called as part of expression                  4>its always called as part of
